### **AWS Code for Spam Detection: Detailed Description**

This code provides a comprehensive workflow for detecting spam emails from a dataset stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The process involves extracting, cleaning, and analyzing email data using SQL-based queries in AWS environments such as **AWS Athena** or **AWS Glue**. It also implements **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** calculations to identify the most relevant keywords associated with spam and ham (legitimate) emails.  

---

### **1. Data Ingestion and Initial Setup**
1. **Create the Main Table (`email_blog_data`):**
   - This table is populated with raw email data from the CSV file stored in the S3 bucket (`s3://sommie/data1/`).
   - It contains fields such as:
     - **DateTime_**: Timestamp of the email.
     - **From_Address, To_Address, Cc_Address**: Email participants.
     - **Subject and Body**: Content of the email.
     - **Class Sentiment & Alignment**: Pre-existing sentiment labels.
     
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE email_blog_data (...) 
   ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
   FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
   LOCATION 's3://sommie/data1/';
   ```

2. **Preview Data:**
   - Display the first 10 rows for validation.
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM email_blog_data LIMIT 10;
   ```

---

### **2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
1. **Select Relevant Columns:**
   - Create a new table `new_email_blog_data` with only essential fields:
     - DateTime_, From_Address, To_Address, Cc_Address, Subject, Body.
   
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE new_email_blog_data AS
   SELECT DateTime_, From_Address, To_Address, Cc_Address, Subject, Body
   FROM email_blog_data;
   ```

2. **Handle NULL Values:**
   - Replace `NULL` with an empty string using the `CONCAT_WS()` function.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE clean_new_email_blog_data AS
   SELECT DateTime_, CONCAT_WS(',', From_Address) AS From_Address, ...
   FROM new_email_blog_data;
   ```

3. **Remove Unnecessary Characters:**
   - Clean the email addresses and content by removing brackets and quotes.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE cleaned_email_data AS
   SELECT DateTime_, regexp_replace(From_Address, "[\"'\\[\\]]", '') AS From_Address, ...
   FROM clean_new_email_blog_data;
   ```

---

### **3. Spam and Ham Classification**
1. **Identify "Ham" Emails (Legitimate Emails):**
   - Create a table `ham_clean_email_data` with emails containing work-related keywords.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE ham_clean_email_data AS
   SELECT *
   FROM cleaned_email_data
   WHERE LOWER(Subject) LIKE '%work%' OR LOWER(Body) LIKE '%project%' ...;
   ```

2. **Identify "Spam" Emails:**
   - Create a `spam_clean_email_data` table by filtering out promotional/scam-related keywords.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE spam_clean_email_data AS
   SELECT *
   FROM cleaned_email_data
   WHERE LOWER(Subject) LIKE '%lottery%' OR LOWER(Body) LIKE '%free%' ...;
   ```

---

### **4. Analyzing Spam and Ham Patterns**
1. **Count Spam Emails per Recipient:**
   - Generate the `spam_clean_email_count` table to find how many spam emails each account received.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE spam_clean_email_count AS
   SELECT To_Address AS Email_id, COUNT(*) AS Spam
   FROM spam_clean_email_data
   GROUP BY To_Address;
   ```

2. **Top 10 Spam Targets:**
   - Identify the top 10 accounts receiving the most spam.
   ```sql
   SELECT Email_id, Spam
   FROM spam_clean_email_count
   ORDER BY Spam DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

3. **Count Ham Emails per Sender:**
   - Similar logic applies to create `ham_clean_email_count` to track legitimate communication patterns.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE ham_clean_email_count AS
   SELECT From_Address AS Email_id, COUNT(*) AS Ham_Count
   FROM ham_clean_email_data
   GROUP BY From_Address;
   ```

4. **Top 10 Ham Senders:**
   - Identify the most frequent legitimate communicators.
   ```sql
   SELECT Email_id, Ham_Count
   FROM ham_clean_email_count
   ORDER BY Ham_Count DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

### **5. Advanced Analysis with MapReduce and TF-IDF**
This section implements a **MapReduce** workflow to extract the most significant keywords for spam and ham emails using **TF-IDF**.

---

#### **Step 1: Tokenization**
1. **Tokenize Spam Emails:**
   - Split email subjects into words for further analysis.
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE spam_email_token AS
   SELECT From_Address AS account_id, SPLIT(LOWER(Subject), ' ') AS words
   FROM spam_clean_email_data;
   ```

2. **Tokenize Ham Emails:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE ham_tokens AS
   SELECT To_Address AS account_id, word
   FROM ham_clean_email_data
   LATERAL VIEW EXPLODE(SPLIT(LOWER(CONCAT(Subject, ' ', Body)), ' ')) exploded_words AS word;
   ```

---

#### **Step 2: Term Frequency (TF) Calculation**
- Calculate how often each word appears within each account.

1. **Spam TF Calculation:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE spam_email_tf AS
   SELECT account_id, word, COUNT(word) AS term_frequency
   FROM spam_email_token
   LATERAL VIEW EXPLODE(words) wordsTable AS word
   GROUP BY account_id, word;
   ```

2. **Ham TF Calculation:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE ham_email_tf AS
   SELECT account_id, word, COUNT(1) AS term_frequency
   FROM ham_tokens
   GROUP BY account_id, word;
   ```

---

#### **Step 3: Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) Calculation**
- Measure how unique a word is across all accounts.

1. **Spam IDF Calculation:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE spam_email_idf AS
   SELECT word, LOG10(COUNT(word) / document_frequency) AS inverse_document_frequency
   FROM spam_email_df
   GROUP BY word, document_frequency;
   ```

---

#### **Step 4: TF-IDF Calculation**
1. **Spam TF-IDF Calculation:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE spam_email_tfidf AS
   SELECT t.account_id, t.word, t.term_frequency * i.inverse_document_frequency AS tfidf
   FROM spam_email_tf t
   JOIN spam_email_idf i ON t.word = i.word;
   ```

---

#### **Step 5: Extract Top Keywords**
- Identify the most important words contributing to spam and ham classification.

1. **Spam Top Keywords:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE spam_email_top_keywords AS
   SELECT account_id, word, tfidf
   FROM (
       SELECT account_id, word, tfidf,
              ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY tfidf DESC) AS rk
       FROM spam_email_tfidf
   ) ranked
   WHERE rk <= 10;
   ```
